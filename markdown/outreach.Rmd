I am passionate about scientific outreach and believe that participation in outreach activities creates many opportunities to grow as a scientist. 

For the past two years, I have been a GRASSHOPR fellow as a part of the graduate student outreach program at Cornell University. As a fellow, I have developed a four lesson course aimed at teaching elementary aged students the basic principles of Entomological research. I taught the course once over Zoom and another time in person. [Click here](https://sites.google.com/view/grasshopratcornell/home) to learn more about the GRASSHOPR program.

I am also Co-chair of the Outreach committee for Jagatae (Graduate Student Club for Entomology) I have been involved in the planning and implementation of creating a “hands-on” teaching collection for outreach purposes as well as a workshop for the Expanding your Horizons (EYH) conference at Cornell.
